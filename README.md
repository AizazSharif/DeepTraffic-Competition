# DeepTraffic-Competition
A Deep Reinforcement Learning problem of a Self-driving car was opened as a competiton. Registered people had to make changes in Network so that it can achieve max avergae speed in MPH.

In version 1.0 I reached to 10th position by getting help from different sources and using my basic Deep RL knowledge so far.
